Played on your world and realised that that campfire you placed in your house looks better on than off, but thereâ€™s a problem. The smoke. The smoke is very annoying when in enclosed builds and this pack can help with that. This pack was made to remove the annoying campfire smoke, this can be used if it is getting in the way/looks bad with your build.
