<img src="/all/intro.png" alt="intro">

Have you seen my Lower Swords pack? If yes, this is the opposite of that pack, it makes the swords annoyingly long! This was a suggestion in my discord server so i decided to make it a thing. Thanks s2k! This pack was made to make the swords annoyingly long.

This works on all devices and all platforms that can import these mods. Performance will stay the same, textures are almost the same.
