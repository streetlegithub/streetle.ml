<title>Who is streetle?</title>

<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/icons/who.png">

My online name is streetle, I mainly use discord to chat with anyone, my username is <i>streetle#9853</i>.

I usually play games on my xbox, and the odd mobile game when I'm bored.

I plan to buy a PC/Laptop within this year, however inflation is an <strong>idiot</strong>.

## The backstory behind my name
My last name is street. Hence "street". And the first 2 letters of my first name are "le", hence "le".
Put it all together, and you have "streetle"!

## Why I chose Xbox
I chose xbox because of the simplicity. I prefer an easy to use UI, over a bright animated in your face screen. I don't really enjoy the Playstation UI.
I also chose it because I prefer the faster power.

## Why not get a PC?
I bought my xbox when I was very young, so I didn't understand how important and more useful a PC would be. So I just haven't had the time or money to get a PC yet.
