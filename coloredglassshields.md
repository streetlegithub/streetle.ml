Have you ever used a shield in minecraft and realised that they are so big and obnoxious? They take up too much of your screen as well. So, I came up with a solution that is both pretty and useful at the same time! Shields + Colored Glass = Colored Glass Shields!

This pack adds 10+ colored glass shields to your game! It is highly customisable and I will add any colors you want me to in the comments :)

This edits the “Shield” Model and Texture to make it look very colorful.

To edit the color you want, click on the pack and click the “Cog/Gear” icon. It looks like this:

This works on all devices and all platforms that can import these mods. It will not degrade performance. Performace will be equal to regular gameplay.
