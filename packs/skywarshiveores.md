## Skywars Hive Ores

<img src="/all/intro.png" alt="intro">

Have you ever played on the hive? Noticed how all the ores look really boring and bland, not knowing what’ll come out of them?
This pack makes the ores textures change to what they actually drop.

This pack was made for a popular Minecraft bedrock edition server called The Hive, I really recommend playing it sometime. I wouldn’t recommend using this on a normal world, this is designed and made for The Hive.
This pack is a QOL pack (quality of life) that makes a bunch of small improvements to Skywars to make your gameplay more fun!

It works just like any other resource pack out there, nothing special.

This works on all devices and all platforms that can import these mods. Performance may slightly decrease, high quality textures have to load.
