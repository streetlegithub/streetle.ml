Did you ever try and build a setup in Minecraft, but gen you realised that none of the blocks actually look like a keyboard? That all of the tutorials you use look nothing remotely like what you wanted? Well, this pack will solve your issues!

This mod adds a Gaming Keyboard into the game, it has RGB colors and fits well in setups.

It works by adding a texture and a model to the block “Keyboard”. It has no recipe and cannot be crafted in survival.
