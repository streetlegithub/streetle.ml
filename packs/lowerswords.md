## Lower Swords

<img src="/all/intro.png" alt="intro">

Have you ever watched your favourite youtuber and noticed that their swords are short? Well, if you have, now you can be like them! This pack makes the swords smaller and lower.
If you're tired of the huge swords taking up so much space on your screen in Minecraft, then you might want to check out the Lower Swords mod for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. As the name suggests, this mod changes the texture of all the swords in the game to be lower down on the screen, making them take up less space and freeing up more of your screen real estate.

One of the great things about the Lower Swords mod is that it's a simple yet effective way to improve your gameplay experience. By reducing the size of the swords, the mod makes it easier to see what's happening in the game world around you. This can be especially helpful in fast-paced situations where every pixel counts, such as in PVP battles or when trying to navigate through tight spaces.

This pack was made for PvP players and content creators to have a better view of their screen by removing the top half of the swords and making it easier to see. Whilst also keeping the original textures for sword, just cut it half.

Overall, the Lower Swords mod is a must-have for any Minecraft player who wants to reduce the size of the swords on their screen. So if you want to free up more of your screen real estate and improve your gameplay experience, give this mod a try today!
