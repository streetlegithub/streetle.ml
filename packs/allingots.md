If you've ever found it confusing to keep track of all the different ore types in Minecraft, then you might want to check out the All Ingots mod for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. This mod simplifies the appearance of the ores in the game by turning every smelted ore into an ingot texture. This makes it easier to understand what you have and search for specific items.

One of the great things about the All Ingots mod is that it's a simple yet effective way to improve your gameplay experience. By standardizing the appearance of the ores, the mod makes it easier to organize and manage your inventory. This can be especially helpful if you're someone who likes to keep a well-organized inventory or if you're just starting out in the game and trying to get a handle on all the different ore types.
Noticed that Iron and Gold are both ingots? What about diamonds, coal and emeralds? Well, look no further, this pack will make emeralds, coal and diamonds into ingots, whilst still functioning the same. This pack was made to insure that all ores, when smelted, turn into ingots. It is only a texture pack, does not affect gameplay.
Overall, the All Ingots mod is a great choice for any Minecraft player who wants to simplify the appearance of the ores in the game and make their inventory easier to manage. So if you want to streamline your gameplay and make your inventory more organized, give this mod a try today!
