## All Ingots

<img src="/all/intro.png" alt="intro">

Noticed that Iron and Gold are both ingots? What about diamonds, coal and emeralds? Well, look no further, this pack will make emeralds, coal and diamonds into ingots, whilst still functioning the same. This pack was made to insure that all ores, when smelted, turn into ingots. It is only a texture pack, does not affect gameplay.

Changes emerald.png, coal.png and diamond.png textures to be ingots and colored their respected colors.

This works on all devices and all platforms that can import these mods. Performance will stay the same, textures are still 16x16.
