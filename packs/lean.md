## Lean!

<img src="/all/intro.png" alt="intro">

Lean! I made the “Lean” meme in Minecraft Bedrock Edition for free for everyone to try out for themselves! This pack is finished and 100% works. This has been tested multiple times and it has always worked. This mod adds the “lean” meme into minecraft with water. It works everywhere and is very cool.

It is basically purple water. Works for content creation and you can use the files in your pack without my permission.The lean meme can be explained here: https://amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-love-lean

This works by editing the “water” texture in the resource pack, it colorizes the blue water into purple, seamlessly!

This will work on any device, it does not reduce performance at all as it is just a slightly edited version of the regular minecraft water. You should see the same performance with the resource pack and without the resource pack.
