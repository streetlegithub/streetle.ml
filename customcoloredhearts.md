## Custom Colored Hearts

<img src="/all/intro.png" alt="intro">

This pack changes the colors of the hearts that are above your hotbar.  This pack currently has 11 colors. This pack will be updated on a regular basis. I reccomend joining the discord for color suggestions.
This pack adds 10+ colored hearts to your game! It is highly customisable and I will add any colors you want me to in the MCPEDL comments :)

This edits the “Heart” texture to make it look very colorful.

To edit the color you want, click on the pack and click the “Cog/Gear” icon. It looks like this:

This works on all devices and all platforms that can import these mods. It will not degrade performance. Performace will be equal to regular gameplay.
