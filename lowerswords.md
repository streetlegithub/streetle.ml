## Lower Swords

<img src="/all/intro.png" alt="intro">

Have you ever watched your favourite youtuber and noticed that their swords are short? Well, if you have, now you can be like them! This pack makes the swords smaller and lower.

This pack was made for PvP players and content creators to have a better view of their screen by removing the top half of the swords and making it easier to see. Whilst also keeping the original textures for sword, just cut it half.

It works just like any other resource pack out there, nothing special.

This works on all devices and all platforms that can import these mods. Performance will not change.

Performance will be equal to regular gameplay.
